# Customer Brand Recommendation System

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to recommend or purchase a brand based on demographic and behavioral data.

##Project Objectives
- Analyze customer data to understand purchasing behavior
- Build a predictive model using Naïve Bayes
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

##Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Purchase Amount
- Purchase Frequency
- Loyalty Score
- Recommendation Status (Target)

##Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

##Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and encoding
4. Model training using Gaussian Naïve Bayes
5. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##Results
The Naïve Bayes model successfully classified customer recommendation likelihood with good accuracy and clear insights into customer behavior patterns.
